# Week 1 - Rapid Intro and Data Types

## Notes
### Rapid Intro to Procedural Programing

### Data Types

## Python Quizmaster
Develop an interactive multiple choice quiz matching python built in keywords to a one-sentence 
definition you write for them. All keywords can be found by typing dir(__builtins__)  into
an interactive python session. Research each one and construct a mapping of keywords to 
definitions. Then develop functionality to prompt the user with the correct answer and three 
wrong answers (perhaps chosen randomly from your bank of definitions). Collect the response for
each question and output a quiz summary at the end. Be as extra as you please.

## Pi Writing Contest
Write a script to print as many digits of pi as possible. You will have to address the concepts of 
float precision and memory allocation (and perhaps even string formatting) to get lots of digits. 
Convert your result to a string and compare element-wise to a string of pi copied from the internet.
Output the number of decimal places you get correct. Bonus points for a fun visualization.
